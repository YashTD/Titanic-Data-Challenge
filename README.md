# Titanic Data Challenge

I first ventured into kaggle competitions with the [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) in 2017 and my solution, with a thorough exploration of logistic regression can be found in [this notebook](Titanic_Data_Challenge.ipynb). The final mean accuracy achieved is **78%** on the test data on kaggle.
